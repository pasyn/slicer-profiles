# slicer-profiles
My personal print profiles for various filaments and printers

Folders organized as follows:
(filament brand - filament type) -> (printer - extruder) -> (slicer(cura/prusaslicer/slic3r)) -> (resolution - support/raft/experimental/etc)

For example:
Overture - Nylon -> Prusa MK3s - Bondtech -> 0.15 - noSupport

Not all slicers and print resolutions will be populated.
Each folder should have a README.md for documentation/notes.

Feel free to submit a pull request to include your print profiles in this repo.

For precision calibration try using the calibration features built into superslicer.
